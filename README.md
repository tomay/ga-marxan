Testing r functions for reproducing Marxan-like optimization using genetic algorithms

Marxan cost functions
---------------------
The main contribution so far is r-functions for calculating Marxan costs for a given set of planning units (e.g. the marxan objective function).

Genetic algorithm
-----------------
The genetic algorithm is not yet included here pending publication by collaborators, but contact me if you would like more information.
